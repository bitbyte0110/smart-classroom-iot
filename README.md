1Ô∏è‚É£ Module 3: Smart Lighting Control (LDR + PIR + LED)

Easiest to wire, lowest risk.





Only 3 components + ESP32 ‚Üí quick success.





You‚Äôll learn:





How to read sensors (analog + digital).





How to drive an LED with PWM.





How to publish to MQTT / Pi dashboard.





Perfect first demo ‚Üí LED brightens/dims based on light + motion.





üëâ Start here. It builds your confidence and gives you something to show fast.



2Ô∏è‚É£ Module 2: Smart Climate Control (Fan + DHT22)

Next complexity: DHT22 sensor (digital data protocol).





Fan requires transistor + diode ‚Üí introduces actuator driving concept.





Adds control logic (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH).





Pi dashboard can display temperature + fan speed.







3Ô∏è‚É£ Module Extra 2: Air Quality Monitoring (MQ-135)

Simple wiring but sensor is a bit ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù and needs calibration.





Good to add after you‚Äôre confident with MQTT + dashboard.





Useful to show ‚ÄúGood/Moderate/Poor‚Äù status on the website.







4Ô∏è‚É£ Module 1: Smart Door Access (RFID or ESP32-CAM)

Hardest: needs RFID/Camera + servo control + logging.





More code (Firebase or local DB).





Do last, after you‚Äôve mastered ESP32 ‚Üí MQTT ‚Üí Pi dashboard flow.







Extra (Voice Control via Google Assistant / App)

This is not hardware-heavy, but needs integration with Blynk / Node-RED / IFTTT.





Add it once at least Lighting and Fan modules are stable.







‚úÖ My Suggested Roadmap

Lighting (Module 3) ‚Üí PIR + LDR + LED (auto light + dashboard graph).





Climate (Module 2) ‚Üí DHT22 + Fan (fan speed logic + dashboard).





Air Quality (Extra 2) ‚Üí MQ-135 (display levels + fan trigger).





Door Access (Module 1) ‚Üí RFID/ESP32-CAM + Servo (attendance + safety).





Voice Integration ‚Üí Google Assistant / app control once base modules work.
