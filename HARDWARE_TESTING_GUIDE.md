# 🔧 Hardware Testing Guide - Complete Smart Lighting System

## 🎯 Prerequisites Completed
- ✅ ESP32 flashed with `lighting_complete.ino`
- ✅ WiFi credentials updated in ESP32 code
- ✅ Hardware connected: PIR→GPIO27, LDR→GPIO34, LED→GPIO18
- ✅ Laptop camera working for AI detection

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Start Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Double-click START_COMPLETE_SYSTEM.bat
# This opens all 3 services automatically
```

### Option 2: Manual Start (3 terminals)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Firebase
firebase emulators:start

# Terminal 2: Web Dashboard  
cd web
npm run dev

# Terminal 3: AI Detection
cd AI_detection
python laptop_ai_integration.py
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### 1. 🌞 Bright Room Test
**Goal**: LED should stay OFF even with presence
- **Action**: Cover LDR with hand to simulate darkness, then remove
- **Expected**: 
  - LDR reading < 2800 → LED OFF
  - LDR reading > 3200 + presence → LED ON
- **Dashboard**: Watch "Brightness Level" tile and "LED Status"

### 2. 🌙 Dark Room Test  
**Goal**: LED turns ON with presence in dark conditions
- **Action**: Cover LDR completely, wave at PIR
- **Expected**: 
  - PIR + Dark → LED ON with auto-dimming
  - Darker = Brighter LED (inverse relationship)
- **Dashboard**: LED PWM should increase as LDR value increases

### 3. 🤖 AI Detection Test
**Goal**: AI camera detects your presence
- **Action**: Stand in front of laptop camera
- **Expected**:
  - Green boxes around detected people
  - "People: 1 | Presence: true" status
  - Firebase receives AI data
- **Dashboard**: AI presence status updates

### 4. 🎛️ Manual Mode Test
**Goal**: Override automatic control
- **Action**: Switch to Manual mode in dashboard
- **Expected**:
  - Sensors ignored
  - LED responds only to dashboard controls
  - Slider controls brightness (0-255)
- **Dashboard**: Toggle ON/OFF, adjust slider

### 5. 📶 Offline Test
**Goal**: System continues working without internet
- **Action**: Disconnect WiFi or stop Firebase
- **Expected**:
  - ESP32 continues local sensor control
  - Data buffered for later upload
  - Web dashboard shows last known state
- **ESP32 Serial**: Shows "WiFi disconnected" but keeps running

## 📊 Data Verification

### Real-time Monitoring
- **ESP32 Serial Monitor**: Shows live sensor readings every 2 seconds
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time tiles update automatically
- **AI Window**: Live detection with FPS counter

### Firebase Data Structure
```json
{
  "lighting": {
    "roomA": {
      "state": {
        "presence": true,
        "ldrRaw": 3450,
        "mode": "auto",
        "led": {"on": true, "pwm": 180},
        "ai_presence": true,
        "ai_people_count": 1,
        "ai_confidence": 0.85
      },
      "logs": {
        "1672531200000": { /* Historical data */ }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### ESP32 Issues
```bash
# Serial Monitor shows:
❌ "WiFi connection failed" → Check credentials in .ino file
❌ "Firebase error" → Check API key and database URL
✅ "System ready!" → All good, watch for sensor readings
```

### Camera Issues  
```bash
# AI Detection shows:
❌ "Cannot open camera" → Close other camera apps (Zoom, Teams)
❌ "YOLO model not found" → Check yolo/ folder has .cfg and .weights
✅ "Camera started" → Green boxes should appear around people
```

### Dashboard Issues
```bash
# Web browser shows:
❌ Blank page → Start Firebase emulator first
❌ "Demo mode" → Start AI detection for live data
✅ Live tiles updating → All systems working
```

## 📈 Success Criteria

### ✅ Hardware Integration Working When:
1. **PIR Detection**: Motion triggers presence in serial monitor
2. **LDR Reading**: Values change when covering/uncovering sensor  
3. **LED Control**: Physical LED responds to sensor/manual commands
4. **WiFi Connection**: ESP32 connects to your network
5. **Firebase Sync**: Data appears in web dashboard

### ✅ AI Integration Working When:
6. **Camera Detection**: People appear in green boxes
7. **Presence Logic**: AI presence updates in dashboard
8. **Firebase Updates**: AI data syncs every 3 seconds

### ✅ Complete System Working When:
9. **Auto Mode**: LED responds to both PIR+LDR AND AI camera
10. **Manual Mode**: Dashboard controls override all sensors
11. **Offline Mode**: System works without internet connection
12. **Reports**: Historical data generates charts and analytics

## 🎬 Demo Video Checklist (90s)

Record these scenarios for your assignment:

1. **Auto Logic** (30s):
