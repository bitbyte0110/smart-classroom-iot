Module 3 ‚Äî Smart Lighting Control (ESP32 + PIR + LDR AO + LED)
üéØ Purpose
Automate classroom lighting based on presence and ambient brightness, with monitoring and manual control via Firebase.

‚ö° Features
PIR (GPIO27): Detects human presence.


LDR Module AO (GPIO34): Reads brightness (analog 0‚Äì4095).


LED Demo Light (GPIO18, PWM): Dims automatically in Auto mode; fully user-controlled in Manual mode.


Logic


Presence and Dark ‚Üí LED ON (auto-dim by brightness).


No presence ‚Üí LED OFF (energy saving).


Bright room ‚Üí LED OFF (even if presence).


Firebase Web Dashboard
The system integrates with Firebase Realtime Database.


A web dashboard (accessible via browser) is connected to Firebase and provides:


Real-time display of presence status, brightness value, LED state, and PWM level.


Control panel to switch between Automatic and Manual modes.


In Manual Mode, the user can directly:


Toggle light ON/OFF.


Adjust brightness with a slider (0‚Äì255).


All state changes are synced in real time between the ESP32 device and the Firebase database, ensuring the website always shows live information.



Required Hardware
1 √ó ESP32 (recommended)


1 √ó PIR motion sensor (HC-SR501)


1 √ó LDR module with AO pin (the blue-potentiometer board)


1 √ó LED + 220 Œ© resistor (demo light)


Breadboard, jumper wires, USB cable, power supply



üîå Wiring (ESP32)
LDR Module (AO)
VCC ‚Üí 3.3 V (keeps AO within ESP32 ADC limits)


GND ‚Üí GND


AO ‚Üí GPIO34 (ADC input-only)


PIR (HC-SR501)
VCC ‚Üí 5 V


GND ‚Üí GND


OUT ‚Üí GPIO27 (digital input)


Most modules output ~3.3 V HIGH (safe). If yours is 5 V, add divider: OUT‚Üí220 kŒ©‚ÜíGPIO27, GPIO27‚Üí100 kŒ©‚ÜíGND.


LED (demo light)
GPIO18 (PWM) ‚Üí 220 Œ© ‚Üí LED anode (+)


LED cathode (‚Äì) ‚Üí GND


Common ground: ESP32 GND ‚Üî PIR GND ‚Üî LDR GND ‚Üî LED (‚Äì)

‚öôÔ∏è Control Logic (Auto vs Manual)
Auto Mode
Read PIR (presence) and LDR AO (brightness).


If presence = true and ldrRaw > DARK_THRESHOLD ‚Üí LED ON with PWM mapped from LDR (darker = brighter).


If presence = false or ldrRaw < BRIGHT_THRESHOLD ‚Üí LED OFF.


Use hysteresis (two thresholds) to avoid flicker:


BRIGHT_THRESHOLD < DARK_THRESHOLD


Manual Mode
Ignore sensors.


LED obeys Firebase commands: on and pwm (0‚Äì255).





Module Extra 1:Voice Control via Mobile App & Cloud Integration

Overview:
 The system integrates app-based voice control, allowing users to operate classroom devices (lights) hands-free using platforms like Google Assistant.


How It Works:


Users issue voice commands (e.g., ‚ÄúTurn on the classroom ligh and fant‚Äù) through their mobile device or smart speaker.


The mobile app (e.g., Blynk, Node-RED Dashboard, or Google Home) recognizes the command and triggers the corresponding virtual button/action.


The app sends the control signal via WiFi or the cloud to the IoT device (ESP32/NodeMCU).


The IoT device executes the command, turning lights or fan ON/OFF or adjusting settings.


Example Scenario:


The teacher says ‚ÄúOK Google, turn on the classroom light.‚Äù


Google Assistant recognizes the phrase and sends a command to the app.


The app triggers the ESP32 to turn on the light instantly.

‚Ä¢ Log to Firebase every 30‚Äì60s: {ts, presence, ldrRaw(0‚Äì4095), mode('auto'|'manual'), led:{on:boolean,pwm:0‚Äì255}} under /lighting/{roomId}/logs/{ts}. Also mirror live state at /lighting/{roomId}/state.

 ‚Ä¢ Build reports on the web dashboard (read from logs):
 (1) Daily Brightness Line Chart (ldrRaw vs time), (2) Presence Heatmap/Bar (detections per hour), (3) LED Runtime & Avg PWM (minutes ON, mean PWM), (4) Energy Saved vs baseline (assume baseline = LED always ON at PWM=255 during occupied hours).
BMIT2123 Assignment (202505)

 ‚Ä¢ Keep ‚Äúsufficient records‚Äù (at least a few hundred rows over several hours/days) so graphs show clear trends.
BMIT2123 Assignment (202505)
‚úÖ Validations & Business Rules (NEW)
 ‚Ä¢ ADC sanity: clamp ldrRaw to 0‚Äì4095; ignore NaN/-1; apply a 5-sample median filter before mapping to PWM.
BMIT2123 Assignment (202505)

 ‚Ä¢ PIR debounce: require a stable HIGH ‚â•200 ms; add a 2 s cooldown to prevent flicker.
BMIT2123 Assignment Marking Sch‚Ä¶

 ‚Ä¢ PWM guardrails: always clamp 0‚Äì255; if mode=manual and on=false, force PWM=0.
BMIT2123 Assignment (202505)

 ‚Ä¢ Hysteresis constants: BRIGHT_THRESHOLD=2800, DARK_THRESHOLD=3200 (ensure BRIGHT < DARK). Document these in code & UI.
BMIT2123 Assignment (202505)

 ‚Ä¢ Business-rule checks: if presence=true and ldrRaw>DARK_THRESHOLD ‚Üí auto map to PWM; if ldrRaw<BRIGHT_THRESHOLD or presence=false ‚Üí LED OFF. (State machine documented in report.)
BMIT2123 Assignment (202505)
üõ°Ô∏è Exception Handling & Offline Tolerance (NEW)
 ‚Ä¢ Wi-Fi/Firebase down: keep local control running; queue up to 200 log entries in a ring buffer; retry with exponential back-off; flush on reconnect.
BMIT2123 Assignment Marking Sch‚Ä¶

 ‚Ä¢ Sensor faults: if ldrRaw unchanged ¬±5 for >10 min or reads invalid, raise state.sensorError='LDR' and fall back to presence-only control; if PIR stuck, switch to brightness-only. Never crash; no restart needed.
BMIT2123 Assignment Marking Sch‚Ä¶

 ‚Ä¢ Command conflicts: when switching Manual ‚Üî Auto, atomically set mode first, then apply on/pwm to avoid race conditions. Log all overrides in /logs.

üß™ Test Cases for Demo (NEW)
 ‚Ä¢ Bright room + presence ‚Üí LED stays OFF.
 ‚Ä¢ Dark room + presence ‚Üí LED ON, PWM rises as it gets darker.
 ‚Ä¢ Manual mode ‚Üí slider changes PWM instantly; toggle OFF forces PWM=0.
 ‚Ä¢ Network unplugged ‚Üí UI freezes but device still follows sensors; upon reconnection, logs backfill and UI resyncs.
 (These map to Validations/Reports, Exception Handling, and Program Logic marks.)

üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard Extras (NEW)
 ‚Ä¢ Mode switch + live tiles (Presence, LDR, LED ON/OFF, PWM).
 ‚Ä¢ Reports tab with the 4 charts and a CSV export of logs for lecturer verification.
