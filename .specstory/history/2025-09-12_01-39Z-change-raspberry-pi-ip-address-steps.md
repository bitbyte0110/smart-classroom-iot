# Change Raspberry Pi IP address steps (2025-09-12 01:39Z)

_**User (2025-09-12 00:30Z)**_

i change to this address for pi 192.168.202.221, what else i need to changefrom the picture help me check and list down for me to reference so next time when i change address and pi i can reuse the step, is dashboard need to change the address? should not right since it read firebase

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you check what needs to be changed when updating the IP address for your Pi. Let me examine the current files to see what's been updated and what might still need changes.

Now let me check the web dashboard to see if it needs any IP address changes:

Let me also check for any other files that might contain IP addresses:

Now let me create a comprehensive checklist for you. Based on my analysis, I can see that you need to update several files when changing the Pi IP address. Let me create a todo list and then provide you with the complete checklist:

## Todo List

- [x] Update ESP32 Arduino sketch MQTT_HOST to new Pi IP
- [x] Update AI detection script mqtt_host to new Pi IP
- [x] Update Pi bridge script default mqtt-host to new Pi IP
- [x] Update instruction.md with new Pi IP references
- [x] Verify web dashboard does not need IP changes (uses Firebase)
- [-] Create reusable checklist for future IP address changes

Based on my analysis, here's the complete checklist for changing your Pi IP address from `192.168.0.102` to `192.168.202.221`:

## âœ… **Files Updated with New IP Address: 192.168.202.221**

### 1. **ESP32 Arduino Sketch** âœ…
- **File**: `module3_smart_lighting/ASSIGNMENT_COMPLIANT/ASSIGNMENT_COMPLIANT.ino`
- **Line 43**: `const char* MQTT_HOST = "192.168.202.221";`
- **Status**: âœ… Already updated

### 2. **AI Detection Script** âœ…
- **File**: `AI_detection/yolo_force_gpu.py`
- **Line 14**: `mqtt_host="192.168.202.221"`
- **Status**: âœ… Already updated

### 3. **Pi Bridge Script** âœ…
- **File**: `pi_mqtt_firebase_bridge.py`
- **Line 26**: `parser.add_argument('--mqtt-host', default='192.168.202.221')`
- **Line 13**: Usage example in comments
- **Status**: âœ… Already updated

### 4. **Documentation** âœ…
- **File**: `instruction.md`
- **Multiple lines**: All IP references updated to `192.168.202.221`
- **Status**: âœ… Already updated

### 5. **Web Dashboard** âœ…
- **Files**: `web/src/firebase.ts` and other web files
- **Status**: âœ… **NO CHANGES NEEDED** - You're correct! The dashboard reads from Firebase, not directly from the Pi IP

## ðŸ“‹ **Reusable Checklist for Future IP Address Changes**

When you change your Pi IP address next time, follow this checklist:

### **Files to Update:**
1. **ESP32 Arduino Sketch**
   - File: `module3_smart_lighting/ASSIGNMENT_COMPLIANT/ASSIGNMENT_COMPLIANT.ino`
   - Change: `const char* MQTT_HOST = "OLD_IP";` â†’ `const char* MQTT_HOST = "NEW_IP";`

2. **AI Detection Script**
   - File: `AI_detection/yolo_force_gpu.py`
   - Change: `mqtt_host="OLD_IP"` â†’ `mqtt_host="NEW_IP"`

3. **Pi Bridge Script**
   - File: `pi_mqtt_firebase_bridge.py`
   - Change: `default='OLD_IP'` â†’ `default='NEW_IP'`
   - Also update usage example in comments

4. **Documentation**
   - File: `instruction.md`
   - Search and replace all instances of old IP with new IP

5. **Batch Files** (if any)
   - File: `start_system.bat`
   - Update any hardcoded IP references

### **Files that DON'T need changes:**
- âœ… **Web Dashboard** - Uses Firebase, not direct Pi connection
- âœ… **Firebase configuration** - Cloud-based, no IP dependencies
- âœ… **Node modules** - Third-party dependencies

### **Quick Search Command:**
Use this command to find all IP references in your project:
```bash
grep -r "192.168\." . --exclude-dir=node_modules
```

### **Verification Steps:**
1. Flash updated ESP32 code
2. Run AI script with new IP
3. Start Pi bridge with new IP
4. Test MQTT connection: `mosquitto_sub -h NEW_IP -t '#' -v`
5. Verify web dashboard still works (it should, since it uses Firebase)

**You're all set!** Your system should now work with the new Pi IP address `192.168.202.221`. The web dashboard will continue to work because it reads data from Firebase, not directly from the Pi.
