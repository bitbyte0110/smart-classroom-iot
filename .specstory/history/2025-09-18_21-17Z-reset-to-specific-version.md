_**Assistant**_

I'll help you reset to that specific commit. Let me first check the current git status and then reset to the commit you specified.


---

```bash
git status
```

```
On branch video1
Your branch is behind 'origin/video1' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .specstory/history/2025-09-18_11-45Z-fixing-firebase-admin-module-error.md                                                                              
        .specstory/history/2025-09-18_12-23Z-fix-recording-status-issue-in-voice-control.md                                                                     
        .specstory/history/2025-09-18_12-39Z-fix-recording-issue-after-stop-command.md                                                                          
        .specstory/history/2025-09-18_21-07Z-voice-control-not-stopping-recording.md                                                                            

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

---

Now let me check if the commit hash exists and then reset to it:


---

```bash
git log --oneline -10
```

```
bdd90f9 (HEAD -> video1) AQ need test
cbdc8c1 Voice done should be
df1c8f2 voice may done 1
3056fc6 led voice test2
57f9a1a (voice, video) LED fix 2
8a42cfc led fix
e1f89f9 AI2
c37341e AI people update1
6278a0a led 2
4bf6cba ai change
```

---

Perfect! I can see that the commit `bdd90f9` (which matches the beginning of your hash `bdd90f9fb607f3b85ec17320da85d7a6d9775e1e`) is already the current HEAD commit. However, since you want to reset to this specific version, let me perform a hard reset to ensure we're exactly at that commit and clean up any uncommitted changes:


---

```bash
git reset --hard bdd90f9fb607f3b85ec17320da85d7a6d9775e1e
```

```
da85d7a6d9775e1e                                                                
HEAD is now at bdd90f9 AQ need test
```

---

Great! Now let me verify the reset was successful and check the current status:


---

```bash
git status
```

```

Perfect! I've successfully reset your repository to commit `bdd90f9fb607f3b85ec17320da85d7a6d9775e1e`. Here's what happened:

âœ… **Reset completed successfully!**

- Your repository is now at commit `bdd90f9` with the message "AQ need test"
- The working directory is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- The only files showing are untracked `.specstory` history files, which are not part of your main codebase

**Current status:**
- You're on the `video1` branch
- Your local branch is 1 commit behind the remote `origin/video1`
- All your code files are now at the exact state they were in at that commit

The reset was successful and your codebase is now exactly as it was at commit `bdd90f9fb607f3b85ec17320da85d7a6d9775e1e`. If you need to update to the latest remote changes later, you can run `git pull` when you're ready.
