I'll help you change the window name from "Force GPU YOLO" to "AI Human Presence Detection" in the `yolo_force_gpu.py` file.

Perfect! I've successfully changed the window name from "Force GPU YOLO" to "AI Human Presence Detection" in the `yolo_force_gpu.py` file. 

The change was made on line 251 where the `cv2.imshow()` function is called. Now when you run the AI detection script, the window will display with the more descriptive title "AI Human Presence Detection" instead of the generic "Force GPU YOLO".

The window will now clearly indicate that it's showing AI-powered human presence detection, which is more user-friendly and descriptive of what the application actually does.
