Perfect! I can see you have a Vite-based React application. To make your website accessible from your phone, you need to configure the Vite development server to accept connections from other devices on your network. Here's how to do it:

Perfect! I've configured your Vite development server to be accessible from your phone. Here's what I've done and what you need to do next:

## ‚úÖ Configuration Complete

I've updated your `web/vite.config.ts` file to:
- Set `host: '0.0.0.0'` to allow external connections
- Set `port: 5173` (Vite's default port)

## üì± How to Access from Your Phone

Based on your network configuration, I can see you have two possible IP addresses:

1. **WiFi Connection**: `192.168.225.134` (most likely what you want)
2. **Ethernet**: `192.168.56.1` (if using wired connection)

## üöÄ Steps to Access from Your Phone:

1. **Start your development server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Make sure your phone is connected to the same WiFi network** as your computer

3. **Open your phone's browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://192.168.225.134:5173
   ```

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Alternative Method (if the above doesn't work):

If you want to use a different port or the default doesn't work, you can also start the server with explicit host settings:

```bash
cd web
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

Then access via: `http://192.168.225.134:3000`

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Note:

The current configuration is for development only. The server will be accessible to any device on your local network. Make sure you're on a trusted network (like your home WiFi) when using this setup.

Your website should now be accessible from your phone! Try accessing `http://192.168.225.134:5173` in your phone's browser. If you encounter any issues, let me know and I can help troubleshoot further.

where to check my wifi connection, u means on pc wifi address? or 

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you need to check your PC's WiFi IP address! Let me clarify and help you find the correct one.

The IP address I showed you (`192.168.225.134`) is your PC's WiFi connection address, which is what you need for your phone to access the website.

Let me show you exactly where to find this information:


---

```bash
ipconfig | findstr "Wireless LAN adapter WLAN" -A 5
```

```
FINDSTR: Cannot open -A
FINDSTR: Cannot open 5
```

---

Let me use a different approach to show you the WiFi information clearly:


---

```bash
ipconfig | findstr "WLAN" -A 10
```

```
PS D:\Development\smart-classroom-iot> ipconfig | findstr "WLAN" -A 10
FINDSTR: Cannot open -A
FINDSTR: Cannot open 10
```

---

Let me use PowerShell's native filtering:


---

```bash
ipconfig | Select-String "WLAN" -Context 0,5
```

```
0,5                                                                             

> Wireless LAN adapter WLAN:

     Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
     Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::5b54:317f:12e5:6426%7
     IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.225.134
     Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
```

---

Perfect! Here's exactly what you need to know:

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Your PC's WiFi IP Address

**Your PC's WiFi IP address is: `192.168.225.134`**

This is the address your phone needs to connect to your website.

## üîç Where to Check This Information

You can find this information anytime by running:
```bash
ipconfig
```

Look for the section that says **"Wireless LAN adapter WLAN"** and find the **"IPv4 Address"** - that's your PC's WiFi IP address.

## üì± How to Access from Your Phone

1. **Make sure both devices are on the same WiFi network**
   - Your PC is connected to WiFi
   - Your phone is connected to the same WiFi network

2. **Start your development server** (if not running):
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **On your phone's browser, go to**:
   ```
   http://192.168.225.134:5173
   ```

## üîÑ If Your IP Changes

Note that your WiFi IP address might change if you:
- Restart your router
- Disconnect and reconnect to WiFi
- Your router assigns new IPs

If the address stops working, just run `ipconfig` again to get the new IP address.

The key point is: **use your PC's WiFi IP address** (not localhost/127.0.0.1) so your phone can find your PC on the network!
