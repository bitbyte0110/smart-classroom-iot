@ASSIGNMENT_COMPLIANT.ino when i run come out the error like picture shows 

but when i run @test_firebase_connection.py âœ… Firebase connection test passed

_**Assistant**_

I can see from the Arduino IDE output that you're getting a connection error when compiling/uploading the Arduino sketch. The specific error appears to be "Connection lost. Cloud sketch actions and updates won't be available." and "Compiling sketch..."

Let me help you troubleshoot this issue by examining your Arduino code and providing solutions.

Based on the error you're seeing and the code analysis, here are the common issues and solutions for Arduino IDE compilation errors with ESP32:

## **Arduino IDE Setup Issues & Solutions**

### **1. Board Configuration Issues**
The most common cause of compilation errors is incorrect board settings.
