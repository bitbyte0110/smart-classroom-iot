_**Assistant**_

Looking at the `VoiceControl.tsx` component, this module provides **voice control functionality** for the smart classroom IoT system. Here's what it does:

## Main Purpose
The VoiceControl component enables users to control the smart classroom devices (lighting and climate control) using voice commands instead of manual buttons.

## Key Features

### 1. **Voice Recognition Setup**
- Uses the Web Speech API (`SpeechRecognition` or `webkitSpeechRecognition`)
- Configures continuous listening with interim results
- Supports English (en-US) language
- Handles browser compatibility and error states

### 2. **Dual Module Support**
The component works with two different modules:
- **Lighting Control**: Voice commands for lights
- **Climate Control**: Voice commands for fans

### 3. **Voice Commands for Lighting**
- `"Turn on light"` / `"Lights on"` → Turns lights on
- `"Turn off light"` / `"Lights off"` → Turns lights off
- `"Increase brightness"` / `"Brighter"` → Increases brightness by 50%
- `"Lower the light"` / `"Dim"` → Decreases brightness by 50%
- `"Maximum brightness"` / `"Full"` → Sets to maximum brightness (255)
- `"Minimum brightness"` / `"Low"` → Sets to minimum brightness
- `"Medium brightness"` / `"Mid"` → Sets to medium brightness

### 4. **Voice Commands for Climate Control**
- `"Turn on fan"` / `"Start fan"` → Turns fan on
- `"Turn off fan"` / `"Stop fan"` → Turns fan off
- `"Increase fan speed"` → Increases fan speed by 50%
- `"Lower fan speed"` → Decreases fan speed by 50%
- `"Fan maximum speed"` / `"Fan high"` → Sets fan to maximum speed
- `"Fan low speed"` / `"Fan min"` → Sets fan to low speed
- `"Fan medium speed"` / `"Fan mid"` → Sets fan to medium speed

### 5. **Mode Control**
- `"Auto"` / `"Automatic"` → Switches to automatic mode
- `"Manual"` → Switches to manual mode

### 6. **User Interface**
- Shows listening status ("Listening..." or "Click to start")
- Displays real-time transcript of what the user is saying
- Provides example commands for the current module
- Handles errors gracefully with helpful messages
- Start/Stop button for voice recognition

### 7. **Error Handling**
- Detects unsupported browsers
- Handles microphone permission issues
- Manages network errors
- Provides user-friendly error messages

## How It Works
1. User clicks the start button to begin voice recognition
2. The component continuously listens for speech
3. When speech is detected, it shows interim results
4. When a complete command is recognized, it processes the command
5. The appropriate control function is called (lighting or climate)
6. The component provides visual feedback and example commands

This makes the smart classroom system more accessible and hands-free, allowing users to control lighting and climate systems using natural speech commands.
